## Learning Scala

### Contents

So far, I only have one jupyter notebook.

All of the content in this notebook comes from [this](https://courses.cognitiveclass.ai/courses/course-v1:BigDataUniversity+SC0101EN+2016/courseware/f526aca945084e74b9e036933b20800d/745e70a32f11424da56e5b0e7bc15024/) *Scala 101* course.

I created this for learning purposes only, to help myself retain the material and to help others get up to speed by reading the contents of the presentations and excecuting tiny pieces of code themselves, without having to watch all of the videos.

### How to Use

I recommend cloning this repo and then executing the code snippets yourself.
